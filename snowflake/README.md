# Why should we learn Snowflake?
- Snowflake is relatively new and fresh in the cloud data warehouse space.
- It is purposefully built only for the cloud platform (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Brings many unique features besides workload isolation like:
    Time Travel Feature
    Data Sharing Feature
    Data Cloning Features (Zero Copy Clone)
    Reader's Accounts (for non-Snowflake users)
    Out of box security (RBAC/DAC)/Encryption/Column Level Masking/Row Level Security
    All popular connectors (JDBC/ODBC/Spark and many more)
